,2010,An Approach to Open Data from a Legal Perspective,Stefanie Grunow,,"https://swib.org/swib10/vortraege/swib10_grunow.pptx,http://dx.doi.org/10.4016/27092.01",SWIB/SWIB2010/An Approach to Open Data from a Legal Perspective.md,"#open/data,#open-data,#law,#legal","The area of open data was only marginally noticed by the legislature in the last few changes to copyright law, data protection law and related areas of law. A clear strategy for dealing with the topic of open data, also from a legal point of view, does not yet exist. The lecture should first give an overview of the copyright classification of Open Data in the work types of copyright. In particular, the protection of database manufacturers is considered and a distinction is made from the classic types of copyright work. In order to find alternatives for dealing with free data in practice, the possibilities and limits of various licenses and waivers are explained. #open/data #open-data #law #legal",SWIB
,2010,Collaboration through the Semantic Web: Strategy and Activities of the German National Library,Reinhard Altenhöner,,"[object Object],http://dx.doi.org/10.4016/27094.01",SWIB/SWIB2010/Collaboration through the Semantic Web - Strategy and Activities of the German National Library.md,"#dnb,#knowledge/base,#bibliographic/data,#authority/data,#linked/data,#linked-data,#bibliographic/data,#contentus,#theseus,#web-of-data,#web/of/data,#strategies,#swib/2010","In 2010, the German National Library (DNB - OAI interface) began to publish its knowledge base consisting of bibliographic data and authority data as linked data. Above all, authority data already form an important basis for indexing work in memorial institutions such as museums, archives and libraries. The aim of the DNB is now to enable direct use of the entire national bibliographic data and the authority data by the Semantic Web community by publishing the data as a triple and thus addressing new user groups. This also opens up new ways of cooperative data use: By linking to external data sets from other domains, the bibliographic data gains context and thus relevance on the World Wide Web, while external data sets offer the potential. However, these visible steps are only one link in a chain of other activities, the breeding ground for which are technologies and tools from the Semantic Web environment. This applies in particular to the CONTENTUS use case as part of the THESEUS funding initiative, but also to a number of other projects and plans that serve the purpose of semantically enriching and linking data as well as their adequate (stable) provision and use in new search environments. A new, cooperative dimension of information aggregation, integration and provision comes into view. The long-term goal is to establish libraries and other cultural institutions as a reliable backbone of the web of data. The article presents strategic considerations, concrete plans and activities of the DNB. #dnb #knowledge/base #bibliographic/data #authority/data #linked/data #linked-data #bibliographic/data #theseus #web-of-data #web/of/data #strategies #swib/2010",SWIB
,2010,Exposing the University of Economics' academic bibliography database as linked data,Jitka Hladká,,"https://swib.org/swib10/vortraege/swib10_hladka.pptx,http://dx.doi.org/10.4016/27059.01",SWIB/SWIB2010/Exposing the University of Economics' academic bibliography database as linked data.md,"#zotero,#prague,#rdf,#Czech,#bibliometrics,#MARC,#vocabularies,#ontologies,#sfx,#bibliographic/data,#swib/2010","Academic bibliography of the University of Economics in Prague consists of bibliographic records of publications involving journal articles, conference papers, lecture notes, monographs and monograph chapters created by the academic staff of the university. We would like to discuss the experiences gained in the process of this dataset's transformation from its current data format to RDF-based data. During the course of conversion we will specify the entity types in our data and choose a way to model them. For data description we are going to use the most popular and widely implemented vocabularies and domain ontologies. Next, we will discuss the issues associated with interlinking the data with relevant and well-established datasets constituting a part of the web of data (eg, DBLP Computer Science Bibliography). We would like to examine further possibilities of data re-use by making the data suitable for other applications such as citation managers (eg, Zotero) to generate citations automatically. We are also interested in providing users with the information about availability of a resource as full text or as library holding, so we discuss cooperation with link resolvers (SFX, in our case) as well as other possible ways of linking. In this way, aligned with the concept of the semantic web, we maintain that the potential of the data would be maximized, as the information in bibliographic records would become easy to share, more visible due to incoming links, and more ready to be processed by web applications. We argue that academic bibliography data should be openly available, so it increases transparency of publishing activity of the university' s academic staff. Beyond being reusable, the data can be easily linked to so that they must not be duplicated at multiple locations. Likewise, these features together can provide a few benefits for bibliometric evaluation of science. The adoption of linked data publishing model for academic bibliography datasets involves moving to a more flexible data format for bibliographic data. While linked data is seen as a pragmatic implementation of the semantic web, we argue that it is not possible to implement the library data vision with the MARC, current standard for bibliographic data. Obviously, there is a need for more web-compatible and web-friendly data model. With this in mind, we suggest linked data as a part of the pragmatic implementation of the vision for bibliographic data on the Web. #zotero #prague #rdf #Czech #bibliometrics #MARC #vocabularies #ontologies #sfx",SWIB

However, in order to develop the data web that is developing in this way into a networked knowledge ecosystem that can be used by everyone, there are still a few challenges to be overcome: In addition to improving the quality and coherence of the information in the data web, the creation of direct added value for end users is particularly necessary. Libraries, with their gigantic stocks of knowledge, can make an important contribution to this if, for example, the high-quality bibliographic information is linked to background knowledge from the data web. #bibliographic #libraries",SWIB

Libraries and the Semantic Web.md,"#karen-coyle,#libraries,#FRBR,#rda,#controlled/vocabularies,#data/models,#swib/2010","From the book catalog to the card catalog to the online catalogue, libraries have adapted their practices to take advantage of new technologies, and have used these advancements to better serve library users. The next step in this evolution is already on the horizon: it is the web of data known commonly as the Semantic Web. Reimagining library catalogs as a web of data has great potential for library users and all information seekers. Like the web of documents that is the current World Wide Web, the Semantic Web makes connections between resources. The Semantic Web, however, makes those connections meaningful. The transformation to Semantic Web style of metadata will allow libraries to serve users directly on the web, and will make possible an enhanced discovery environment that links documents and data in a rich web of relationships. The transformation of current library data to "linked data," with entities and relationships, has already begun. After a brief introduction to the concepts that underly the Semantic Web, Coyle will show how the library community is developing the structures necessary for the transformation. This development begins with a domain model (FRBR and other FR's), a standardized definition of data elements (DC, RDA, and others), the definition of relationships (FRBR and RDA), and the creation of machine-readable controlled vocabularies (Library of Congress and RDA). Experimentation with new data models, such as in the Open Library and Freebase, illustrate the value of this approach.

The OAI-ORE standard is used, which enables the addressing and description of deeply nested aggregations. The project makes it clear how central problems from the library and cultural heritage world can be solved with ORE. The W3C standard RDFa allowed the straightforward creation of a REST-based web application. Approaches to overcoming performance and availability bottlenecks will be presented in the lecture.

This "data.bnf.fr" project is still at an early stage. We are only starting to build the information hub that will allow us to gather the data from our various datasets. The BnF wishes to build web pages, gathering resources around the concepts of "works" and "authors". The project involves transforming existing data, enriching and interlinking the dataset with internal and external resources, and publishing HTML pages for browsing by users and search engines. The raw data would also be accessible in RDF following the principles of linked data architecture. Our purpose is to use common standards and to comply with the requirements of the Semantic Web. In this project, it is both a matter of interoperability with external sources, and of our own different datasets, since we have to align resources from several catalogues. Therefore, trying to provide a significant hub in the "linked data" cloud also has strong internal strategic issues, mainly in terms of bibliographic descriptions and choices (eg FRBR, RDA, integration of EAD).
