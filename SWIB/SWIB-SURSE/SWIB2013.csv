AgriVIVO is an RDF-based and ontology-driven global search portal harvesting from distributed directories of experts, organizations and events in the field of agriculture. It is based on the VIVO open source semantic web application initially developed at Cornell University and now adopted by several institutional and cross-institutional research discovery projects in the US and beyond. AgriVIVO builds on the VIVO ontological model - which includes standard ontologies like the geopolitical ontology for locations, the FOAF vocabulary for people and the BIBO ontology for publications, besides the specialized VIVO core ontology - and extends it to better suit the agricultural domain. One of the objectives for this global directory is to provide authoritative data on people and organizations in the agricultural fields: the next steps will focus on disambiguation techniques and the adoption of universal identifiers, especially ORCID, to univocally identify experts and link them to publications, thus laying the ground for authority data on authors. More in details, the talk will cover: the reasons for choosing VIVO over other solutions; the methodology used to extend the VIVO ontology; the workflows and technical solutions adopted for harvesting from different databases; the work done for harmonizing data coming from systems using different semantic organizations; the architecture of the system; URIs, RDF profiles and Linked Data.",SWIB

It was developed in the [Culturegraph](http://culturegraph.org/) project. Since then it has become an important part of the software infrastructure at the German National Library. Core applications of Metafacture are metadata transformation, search indexing and statistical analyses of metadata. Despite originating from the library domain, Metafacture is format-agnostic and has successfully been employed in metadata related tasks in other domains.   In this workshop participants will learn how to use Metafacture in order to analyse large datasets. After a short introduction to Metafacture three types of analyses, which are often encountered in day-to-day work at a library, will be presented: counting distinct data values, quantifying relationships between metadata records and joining metadata records. Participants will have the opportunity to perform these analyses themselves and to discuss their approaches. Prior Experience: No programming experience is required. Participants should have a basic understanding of XML. A library background is not necessary as the analyses presented in the workshop are applicable to other areas as well.",SWIB

The library has an important collection of medieval manuscripts and early printed books that is being digitized at the moment. All digital materials are made available open access as part of the institutional repository. A book reader allows the users to navigate following the physical or logical structure of the work, to access its illustrations or to connect with related documents. In order to go a step forward, the aim of the project being described here was to enrich the experience of the reader by providing additional information extracted from LOD data sets. The idea was that the user could get biographical information about the authors, illustrators, copyist… when accessing the digital version of the books. For that purpose an application was developed to link the book viewer with the LOD sources containing related information. The presentation has two parts. Firstly, we do an analysis of the available LOD sets, the criteria used to select the data sources for the project, the problems faced by the consumer when discovering or searching for LOD sets, and finally the sources selected. In the second part, we describe the algorithm of the application that integrates data extracted from different sources into the book reader. As a test the application was applied to a collection of 92 manuscripts. We make an analysis of the available information and the degree of coverage of the data sources in relation to the number of authors available in the repository.",SWIB

Most library collections, however, are often only partially classified and use local or regional classification systems. Traditionally, manually created mappings between classification systems are used to improve this situation. I propose a different approach to automatically create such mappings: To achieve a large base for the mapping algorithm, bibliographic data from diverse sources that contain items classified by the classification systems is aggregated in a single database. Next, a clustering algorithm is used in order to group individual issues and editions of the same work. The basic idea is that for classification purposes, there is no significant difference across editions. Indexing information can thus be consolidated within the clusters, resulting in a higher proportion of dual-indexed entries. The novel step is that instead of individual catalogue entries, the "work-level" clusters are used for an instance-based matching: Statistical analysis creates a co-occurrence table of pairs of classes and high co-occurance of a given pair indicating a match between the two classification systems. This information is aggregated into a complete mapping The approach is implemented on an open-source infrastructure which was mainly developed by the German National Library: CultureGraph.org. In ongoing projects, mappings between several classification systems are being produced. The talk will discuss the approach, the implementation issues and the preliminary results as well as the challenges of publishing the created mappings as linked data.",SWIB

As a result of the increasing level of digital interconnection in the information world, the established formats used by libraries for exchanging data are no longer deemed fit for purpose. Therefore the Library of Congress launched the "Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative" (BIBFRAME) in 2011, aimed at developing the existing formats into a durable format. The purpose is to assess the viability of the formats, bearing in mind the opportunities presented by semantic web technologies. As a member of the "Early Experimenters Group", the German National Library is actively supporting the initiative as part of its efforts to internationalize the German standards. In the first phase of the BIBFRAME project the main objective of the German National Library is to contribute to the BIBFRAME point papers and to glean experience from prototypical conversion of the German National Library data into the BIBFRAME format. A high potential lies in developing the interoperability with communities from outside the library community and also commercial providers, so that applications can re-use and benefit from the valuable data. Therefore, among other points, the compatibility of the BIBFRAME-model with the Europeana Data Model (EDM) and schema.org is examined. The presentation will give an overview of the BIBFRAME initiative, and provide some insights of the steps taken at the German National Library and in the context of the wider community.",SWIB

ONKI provides a stable, centralized ontology service that allows for the publication of ontologies, searching for them, and provides common ways of utilizing them through various interfaces. The immediate aim is to enable the use of ontologies in the information retrieval systems in, e.g., libraries, museums, archives, governmental bureaus and other public organizations. Through the use of common definitions and URIs for the concepts, the integration between various content becomes simpler. All the code we produce is open source. The other focus of the ONKI project is building and refining the Finnish General Upper Ontology YSO and its Swedish counterpart ALLSO, which have been in use since the early 2000s. Now we wish to evaluate the current state of YSO and whether its hierarchy serves its envisioned usage. To this end we will compare it to similar work done in other countries and also conduct interviews with various user groups. The final vision is to make YSO a national general upper ontology providing the upper level hierarchy as well as concepts that are common to all domains. This is then complemented by various more specific domain ontologies. We have implemented this structure in the form of KOKO, a combination of YSO and fifteen different domain ontologies ranging from agriculture to health to seafaring. This KOKO is already in use in, e.g., various museums as well as in pilot use in the national broadcasting company YLE.",SWIB

Named Entities within texts are recognized and annotated with corresponding entities from a knowledge base. Due to ambiguity of natural language additional information about the named entities is needed as context in order to enable disambiguation between several possible entity candidates. However, to enable semantic analysis of texts in different languages, the applied knowledge base should also provide multi-lingual labels. Unfortunately, most knowledge bases extracted from existing authority files do not fulfill these requirements. DBpedia represents an entity hub within the Linked Data cloud, where semantic information is provided by Wikipedia article texts, page links and interlanguage links. Authority files and in particular knowledge bases based on these authority files would clearly benefit from properly linking their entities to DBpedia. In this talk, we introduce the research issue of cross-lingual entity mapping and propose new methods how to perform high precision mappings of existing authority files to DBpedia. Based on already existing mappings of authority files, such as e.g. persons, locations, or organizations, this contribution concentrates on the mapping of entities that are not assigned to one of these classes.",SWIB

This begs the question: is your tech and organisation up to the challenge? Can you deal with changes outside your control without resorting to aggregation and shuffling large batches of records every night? Does your boss even care? In (re)building the new LIBRIS catalogue backend and cataloguing interface we chose Linked Data as the primary technology, making for example MARC something that happens on the outside of the system, rather than being an integral part of it.

Through utilization of Linked Open Data principles and standards we aim to improve the normalization of the Consortium's metadata, thereby expanding its impact and our ability to share it more widely and effectively both directly with our users and through automated systems. We outline the steps to take the Sheet Music Consortium metadata from its current incarnation as MODS XML files and publish it as linked open data. The Consortium has developed a plan to publish trustworthy data records that are derived from both harvested and user-contributed metadata. First, we identified four metadata elements to target as sources for linked data. These elements are: names of creators, titles of songs, publishers, and subjects. Second, we concluded that despite the high level of attention this metadata has received in its creation and its inclusion in the Consortium, it still is not sufficiently normalized for export to a linked data standard. We will review our strategies for normalizing the metadata values. Third, we will discuss the various methods of employing linked data in the OAI-PMH context, including schema.org and RDF and RDFS. Lastly, we will present the results of a pilot project focusing on publisher information, to take metadata from the Consortium and present it as linked open data. While this case study is focused on sheet music, the methods discussed are generally applicable in the context of harvested metadata.",SWIB

Institutional repositories are no longer restricted to traditional publications. Some repositories have begun to include research data and their metadata. So does PUB. Since research data and publications are related, it is very natural to present this as linked data. By exposing this data and its relationships through standard interfaces, we have opened up PUB to the larger LOD cloud. This will overcome the restrictions of interoperability between repositories. The PUB software is implemented in the open source Perl framework LibreCat/Catmandu (http://github.com/LibreCat). As a first step, we implemented a content negotiation mechanism, a widely used feature in the semantic web. All standard bibliographic formats are supported: OAI-DC, MODS, BibTeX, RIS, and also the JSON and YAML representations of our internal data structure. The RDF representation of the metadata is using the widely used vocabularies BIBO, DCTERMS and FOAF. Future work will involve the linking of the PUB data to external resources, e.g. authority data of the German National Libary, the cross linking to ORCID, Europe PMC or arXiv. Another developing branch will be the interlinking of publications with research data, either contained in our own repository or in an external one. The contextualization of publications and research data in the University's structure will be feasible as soon as the administrative data is published as linked data using VIVO.",SWIB

At hbz, we are working on a LOD API in order to allow this for title and authority data - currently for the hbz union catalog (lobid-resources), the German ISIL registry (lobid-organisations), and the German integrated authority file (GND). The API serves JSON-LD over HTTP. JSON-LD is an attempt to make LOD more accessible to web developers who are not familiar with semantic web concepts. Providing a common HTTP API instead of a SPARQL endpoint or RDF dumps serves the same purpose: to make the data and advantages of LOD available to all web developers, and not to semantic web experts only. In this talk, we will present use cases for the API (like an auto-suggest functionality for authority data), and describe our implementation and the technology stack we use: metadata transformation to N-Triples with the Culturegraph Metafacture toolkit, enrichment and conversion of N-Triples to JSON-LD with Hadoop, indexing JSON-LD with Elasticsearch, and building a web API with the Play framework.",SWIB

Custom-built web applications to enrich web pages with semantic tags "under the hood" require high efforts in programming. Given this dilemma, content management systems (CMS) could be a natural enhancement point for data on the web. In the case of [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), one of the most popular CMS nowadays, Semantic Web enrichment is provided as part of the CMS core. In a simple declarative approach, classes and properties from arbitrary vocabularies can be added to Drupal content types and fields, and are turned into Linked Data on the web pages automagically. The embedded RDFa marked-up data can be easily extracted by other applications. This makes the pages part of the emerging Web of Data, and in the same course helps discoverability with the major search engines.  \nIn the workshop, you will learn how to make use of the built-in Drupal 7 features to produce RDFa enriched pages. You will build new content types, add custom fields and enhance them with RDF markup from mixed vocabularies. The gory details of providing LOD-compatible "cool" URIs will not be skipped, and current limitations of RDF support in Drupal will be explained. Exposing the data in a REST-ful application programming interface or as a SPARQL endpoint are additional options provided by Drupal modules. The workshop will also introduce modules such as Web Taxonomy, which allows linking to thesauri or authority files on the web via simple JSON-based autocomplete lookup, or SPARQL Views as a mighty tool for reaching out to other Linked Data sources.

This talk will present activity and work results of this group, including problems raised and respective solutions. Similar to the related KIM group 'Titeldaten (title data)', the holding data group is developing a best practice guide for holding data in RDF. The goal is to figure out, which data best belongs to a holding description and how this data should be modelled as Linked Data. The result is aligned with related efforts such as the DAIA, BIBFRAME, and FRBR with a strict focus on holdings of libraries and similar institutions.

We have also experimented with semantic enrichment, linking objects to external sources: Geonames, GEMET, and DBpedia. With the results we were able to tune our search engine to perform semantic search functions, e.g., query expansion using hierarchies and translated labels. Finally, we have experimented with new ways of disseminating data. We released a pilot Linked Data service. We also publish RDFa/schema.org mark-up on our web portal. This is still a work in progress, and we are involved in the W3C Schema Bib Extend Group to stay aligned with community expectations. Working on the Europeana scale emphasizes the importance of many aspects beyond technology: cooperation, standardization, legal concerns, and more. Also, it shows that applying separate bits of the semantic web vision – as opposed to implementing the full technical stack at once – already brings benefits.",SWIB

Bringing People to Linked Data.md,"#RDF,#SoylentGreen,#data/entry,#data/storage,#data/discovery,#data/analysis,#linked/data,#people,#swib/2013","Tim Berners-Lee originally framed the Semantic Web as a depersonalized web of data and machinery humming away hidden in server closets. How much this lifeless, impersonal image contributed to RDF's initial adoption difficulties is open to question, but one clear lesson emerged: like the horrifying foodstuff from the cult 70s film "Soylent Green", the Semantic Web is ultimately made of people. People model data, sometimes without even knowing they're doing it. People crosswalk data. People design and configure and use data-entry, data-storage, data-discovery, and data-analysis systems. Without all these people, there can be no Semantic Web. So how do we best invite people -- including skeptical people, reluctant people, less-technical people, people committed to different data structures -- to learn about, contribute to, and use Linked Data?",SWIB
,2013,Specialising the EDM for Digitised Manuscripts,"Steffen Hennicke,Evelyn Dröge,Julia Iwanowa,Kai Eckert,Violeta Trkulja",,,SWIB/SWIB2013/Specialising the EDM for Digitised Manuscripts.md,"#EDM,#DM2E,#Europeana,#vocabularies,#swib/2013","The “Europeana Data Model” (EDM) serves as a generic semantic umbrella for the integration of heterogeneous metadata schemas from many different knowledge domains. In order to capture and retain semantics of specific knowledge domains, the model allows the integration of specific application profiles. The project “Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana” (DM2E) devised one of the first specialisations for the EDM: The DM2E model is an application profile for schemas about handwritten manuscripts. The model integrates standards as diverse as MARC/XML, TEI, EAD or MAB2 and captures specific semantics of manuscript descriptions in the humanities. Thereby, rich semantic statements about cultural heritage objects can be delivered to Europeana and made visible for a broad audience. By explicitly defining classes for datasets and published data resources, the model additionally adheres to Linked Data principles. Resource descriptions are first-class members of the data model and can be used for later user annotations and provenance tracking. In this presentation, we will provide an insight into the creation of the DM2E model: How can the EDM be specialised, which resources were needed for the manuscript domain and how can existing resources be reused? This can serve as guidance for the creation of other (specialised) vocabularies.",SWIB

The next step is to make this data useful for public libraries in a long term perspective. The BnF already displays bibliographic information according to the linked data principles, through data.bnf.fr, an open linked data project that gathers resources and information in pages about authors, themes, and works. Now the question is: how can local libraries take advantage of this project to improve their services to patrons? To experiment a realistic and prospective use case, the BnF started OpenCat, a R&D project financed by the Ministry of Culture of France, together with the Public Library of Fresnes, and a software company, Logilab. Starting from the local library’s functional requirements, a prototype has been built. Relying on permanent identifiers and structured data, it gathers: - information from data.bnf.fr: FRBRized data, links to digital documents, illustrations, - information from the local library like shelfmark, availability, links to subject headings, - snippets, timelines and links to external resources such as conferences, biographical information from the Académie Française and other resources available on the linked open data cloud. Thus new opportunities for cooperation between libraries and for creating a new business model among libraries are arising. This open-source prototype can be seen online with a demo. The next step is to try this prototype in other public libraries, with their own resources and to analyse how they can benefit by sharing resources on the Web, via OpenCat.",SWIB
