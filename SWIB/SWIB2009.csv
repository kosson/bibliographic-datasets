On the one hand, however, these efforts are often about solutions whose sustainability and portability is limited, on the other hand, implicitly existing relationships between bibliographic and administrative information are not taken into account -- which stocks and departments, for example, are actually hidden behind ""computer science""? In the ""Web of Data"," on the other hand"," a wide variety of resources from a wide variety of domains and local as well as global sources can be related to one another and linked to one another. By adhering to a few basic principles"," a high degree of interoperability and reusability of the data can be achieved. With this approach"," the Bochum project ""Integrated Library Portal"" wants to create an infrastructure that can be used to react as flexibly and sustainably as possible to the immediate local conditions (two-tier library system"," University Alliance Metropolis Ruhr) and medium-term requirements (integration of heterogeneous primary data). #linked/data #linked-data #web-of-data #web/of/data #bochum #project #infrastructure #university-alliance-metropolis-ruhr #portal #design #architecture #swib/2009""","SWIB"

Initially, these should be made available in MARC-XML. At the same time, there are various considerations as to how this data can be presented in the framework as linked data. For this, the experience of LIBRIS should be used. This approach is to be extended to other resources at the same time. There are already a few ideas that should be presented in the lecture. #cern #bibliographic/data #MARCXML #libris #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

In order to be able to make better use of sources available on the Semantic Web, such as the standard economics thesaurus, the ZBW has therefore started to develop a lightweight application architecture. It is based on web services that query the data from Semantic Web (-SPARQL) endpoints and make it accessible via a simple, use-case-centric REST interface. This means that the data can be used directly on the websites by conventional web applications. A beta implementation of two key use cases - thesaurus support in indexing and in retrieval - is presented and it is demonstrated. #sparql #thesaurus #indexing #zbw #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

After a few quiet years, developments in the field of the Semantic Web (also) are picking up speed again because (open) linked data is available in large numbers thanks to projects such as DBpedia. However, data is only part of the business. Operating on this data, creating and processing it, is another cornerstone. There is a need to complement the concept of linked data with that of linked applications. This lecture presents an approach to using ontologies as a basis for linked applications using repository software as an example. Software of this type is suitable as an object of investigation simply because there are far-reaching efforts to network it (OA network, DFG call for proposals ""Establishment and networking of repositories""). #linked/data #linked-data #dbpedia #repository #ontologies #oa-network #dfg #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

DBpedia.org was launched in July 2007 and since then has provided Wikipedia databases in several languages in a structured form. Further databases from a wide variety of domains followed within a very short time, including those from the library sector (e.g.: Library of Congress, Swedish Union Catalogue). The central properties of these databases are, firstly, that they can be accessed on the web in a technically simple manner and in a structured form, and secondly, that they contain references (links) to semantically relevant datasets in other databases (e.g.: DBpedia.org). The lecture ""Linked Data in the Context of Digital Library Systems"" first addresses the question ""What is Linked Data?"" received. This is followed by an overview of current developments and trends in the area of linked data that are relevant to libraries. A description of possible advantages and disadvantages for libraries forms the conclusion of the lecture. #dbpedia #swib/2009 #digital-library #sweden #LOD #wikipedia","SWIB",,,,,

The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model is a formal ontology that has been in development since 1996 and is now the official ISO 21127:2006 standard. Although less well known in the library environment than in the museum sector, CIDOC CRM offers a formalized conceptual model to integrate disparately structured information from the field of cultural heritage, preferably in open systems, and to convey and exchange information between applications. The semantic focus is on data structures, terminology for domains and knowledge about entities (time, place, person, object), their properties and relationships with each other. In the article, the CIDOC CRM is to be introduced in relation to selected museum object and context information using the example of the astronomer Tycho Brahe and attention is drawn to the use of the model as a meta-ontology. #cidoc-crm #conceptual-model #conceptual/model #cultural/heritage #entity #meta-ontology #meta/ontology #cidoc #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

However, there is still no unanimous opinion in specialist circles as to what an ontology represents in itself, what properties it has and what potential it conceals. There are basically two perspectives on the nature of ontologies - that of librarians and information specialists, which is determined by the primary semantic interest, and that of programmers, who put the technical problems in the foreground. The ""semantic"" perspective is hardly represented in research and is rarely discussed in the professional world. A detailed discussion in the community can create a better understanding of the advantages of ontologies as a conceptual system and lead to wider use in practice. In the article, this question is discussed from the point of view of information science and explained using a practical example. In addition, practical experience with the development of ontologies using Protégé is reported. #Ontology #conceptual-system #conceptual/system #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

We chose the SKOS (only recently approved as a W3C standard) as the data model. The data is made available as websites with embedded RDFa, as an RDF/XML download and can be queried online (via SPARQL endpoint). What we learned - how we proceeded, what difficulties we had to overcome, what tools we used - and what could be useful for others is the subject of this article. #zbw #skos #rdfa #rdfxml #rdf/xml #sparql #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

After two and a half years of development in an open discussion process with over 100 participants, version 1.3 is now available. of the RDF vocabulary for bibliographic data. Bibo builds on various ontologies such as Dublin Core (DC), Friend of a Friend (FOAF), the Event Ontology and the BBC Program Ontology. After an overview, it will be discussed how the ontology will assert itself as the standard for bibliographic data in the Semantic Web and whether this will make existing bibliographic data formats superfluous. #zotero #RDF #dublin-core #friend-of-a-friend #foaf #ontology #bbc #bibo #bibliographic #bibliographic/data #bibliographic/ontology #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

The service is a work in progress, and in this presentation Anders will describe the strategic thinking behind the LIBRIS Linked Data project, as well as the thoughts and ideas that have emerged as a consequence of it. Such ideas will include the implications of viewing bibliographic information as open networks of data, rather than as closed (or semi-closed) repositories of records. The presentation will also include a discussion of how and why libraries should use linked data as a way of connecting to the rest of the world wide web. #bibliography #sweden #linked-open-data #bibliographic #repository #union-catalog #sweden #libris #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,

In this short lecture, the motivation for this step will be explained and the planned design of the service will be discussed. But it is also about the urgently needed entry into the discussion about the consequences that this new way of data exchange could have for libraries: new cooperation models, extended requirements for cooperative data maintenance and a new regulation of data usage rights. #germany #knowledge/base #swib/2009 #bibliographic/data #authority/files #authority/data #swib/2009","SWIB",,,,,
