,2016,(Packaged) Web Publication,Ivan Herman,,,SWIB/SWIB2016/(Packaged) Web Publication.md,"#epub3,#swib/2016,#digital-books,#ebooks,#books,#IDPF,#web/publication","The publication of EPUB3 has been a major step forward for digital publishing. Relying on Web Technologies like HTML, CSS, SVG, and others, EPUB3 offers a solid basis to publish not only digital books, but all sorts of digital publications in a portable, adaptable and accessible manner. However, it is possible to bring the publishing and the Web world even closer together, making the current format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable and online (Web) document publishing eventually disappear. These should be merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by the user for offline reading in portable document form. Content authored primarily for use as a portable document can be put online, without any need for refactoring the content. Essential features flow seamlessly between online and offline modes; examples include cross-references, user annotations, access to online databases, as well as licensing and rights management. W3C and IDPF have recently started to work towards this vision, exploring the technical challenges to make it a reality; this talk will give an overview on where we are.",SWIB

The "linked data fragments" (LDF) project developed lightweight tools to publish data on the web using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). In combination both projects offer an easy way to transform your data to RDF and provide access via a graphical user interface (GUI) and application programming interface (API). We will present all required tools at the workshop. The participants will be guided to transform data to RDF, to host it with a LDF server and to run SPARQL queries against it. The participants should install a virtual machine (VM) as a development environment on their laptops, see here for further information. Audience: Systems librarians, Metadata librarians, Data manager. Expertise: Participants should be familiar with command line interfaces (CLI) and the basics of RDF.",SWIB

These contextual entities are provided as references as part of the metadata delivered to Europeana or selected by Europeana for semantic enrichment or crowdsourcing. However their diversity in terms of semantic and multilingual coverage and their very variable quality make it difficult for Europeana to fully exploit this rich information. Pursuing its efforts towards the creation of a semantic network around cultural heritage objects and intending in this way to further enhance its data and retrieval across languages, Europeana is now working on a long term strategy for entities. The cornerstone of this strategy is a “semantic entity collection” that acts as a centralised point of reference and access to data about contextual entities, which is based on the cached and curated data from the wider Linked Open Data cloud. While Europeana will have to address the technical challenges of integration and representation of the various sources, it will also have to define a content and curation plan for its maintenance. This presentation will highlight the design principles of the Europeana Entity Collection and its challenges. We will detail our plans regarding its curation and maintenance while providing the first examples of its use in Europeana users' services. We will also reflect on how our goals can fit our partners' processes and how can organizations like national cultural heritage portals and smaller institutions contribute to (and benefit from) such a project as a network.'",SWIB

FREME provides 1) a growing set of general knowledge sources and sources from the library and other domains for enrichment; 2) several widely used content formats as input and output of enrichment processes; 3) the ability to re-use published linked data in enrichment pipelines, and 4) the application of standards and best practices like the W3C Web Annotation model or NIF. The purpose of the FREME framework is to give access to so-called e-Services that provide certain enrichment functionalities, like named entity recognition or terminology annotation. The access is given via APIs and graphical user interfaces, e.g. a plugin for the CKEditor. The FREME documentation provides details on how to access the e-Services. The FREME framework is available as a set of configurable components. Most of the components and e-Services are available under Apache 2.0 license and hence suitable for (commercial) use. All codes are on GitHub, and contributions are very welcome. The goal of this workshop is to enable various types of users to work with FREME. We will start with examples for API users who want to deploy the e-Services endpoints relying on the publicly available FREME installation. We then will show how to install FREME on your own server and how to deploy selected components. Finally we will show how to parameterize FREME, e.g. by working with custom data sets for enrichment or by providing your own e-Service. Participants of the workshop should have basic knowledge of linked data and RESTful web services. We will contact registered participants before the workshop to provide use cases for semantic and multilingual enrichment in the realm of SWIB. We then will provide the participants with material to implement the use cases in the public FREME installation, or in their own installation. For the latter case, participants need to fulfill certain hardware requirements that will be shared before the workshop.",SWIB
,2016,From MARC silos to Linked Data silos,"Osma Suominen,Nina Hyvönen",,,SWIB/SWIB2016/From MARC silos to Linked Data silos.md,"#swib/2016,#silos,#MARC,#Fennica,#Viola,#Arto,#Finland","Many libraries are experimenting with publishing their metadata as Linked Data in order to open up bibliographic silos, usually based on MARC records, and make them more interoperable, accessible and understandable to developers who are not intimately familiar with library data. The libraries who have published Linked Data have all used different data models for structuring their bibliographic data. Some are using a FRBR-based model where Works, Expressions and Manifestations are represented separately. Others have chosen basic Dublin Core, dumbing down their data into a lowest common denominator format. The proliferation of data models limits the reusability of bibliographic data. In effect, libraries have moved from MARC silos to Linked Data silos of incompatible data models. Data sets can be difficult to combine, for example when one data set is modelled around Works while another mixes Work-level metadata such as author and subject with Manifestation-level metadata such as publisher and physical form. Small modelling differences may be overcome by schema mappings, but it is not clear that interoperability has improved overall. We present a survey of published bibliographic Linked Data, the data models proposed for representing bibliographic data as RDF, and tools used for conversion from MARC. We also present efforts at the National Library of Finland to open up metadata, including the national bibliography Fennica, the national discography Viola and the article database Arto, as Linked Data while trying to learn from the examples of others.",SWIB

In the National Library of Finland the national bibliography has been indexed using the YSA general thesaurus since the 1980s. A dedicated browser called VESA was developed in 1999 in order to eliminate the need to publish YSA as a printed document. In user surveys, VESA continually ranked as our most loved service. However, as years went on it became more difficult to integrate VESA’s old code to new environments. When the time came to renew VESA, library world was already buzzing with open linked data, semantic web etc. So it was decided that the new system should provide YSA and other vocabularies as open linked data with the ability to integrate the vocabularies to other systems using modern APIs. In 2013 work begun on the national ontology and thesaurus service Finto slated to replace VESA. Due to VESA being so well-liked, Finto was developed in deep collaboration with the users. Regular usability tests were conducted during the development and in all aspects and features care was taken in order to not put any extra burden on the daily tasks of the annotators. Finto provides the functionalities that VESA did, but also offers various new features and possibilities. An example of an auxiliary feature is the new suggestions system streamlining the process of gathering suggestions for new concepts into Finto vocabularies. Furthermore, the modular design of Finto also allowed us to utilize open APIs in other systems to, e.g., provide direct links to content annotated using a given concept in a vocabulary. We present the lessons learned during the development of a replacement for an extremely well-loved core service of a national library. A particular focus will be on the collaboration with the users during the development process and the migration.",SWIB

The community aims to develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, including image servers and web clients that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images. While the framework supports use by non-semantic clients using JSON, all data models and formats are based on linked data. The IIIF thus provides both a rich environment for semantically aware clients, and an opportunity for support within larger linked-data systems. We believe that the rigor of developing within the framework of linked-data has helped in the development of clean semantics and provides a solid foundation for future work and extension. This workshop will briefly introduce the IIIF Image API, for image access and manipulation, and survey current client application. It will then focus on the IIIF Presentation API and the detailed description how resources are organized, related and presented. Participants will have the opportunity to work through some hands-on examples of manipulation of IIIF presentation information, using JSON-LD and linked-data tools, in order to support different interaction and viewing experiences. Audience: developers, systems librarians, those interested in image provision and presentation. Expertise: Participants should be familiar with the basics of linked data and RDF. In order to work through some hands-on examples then you'll need the ability to edit and run simple (Python) programs. Participants not wanting to do this directly could pair with others to work through examples together. Required equipment to work through examples: Laptop with the ability to run Python (2.7 or 3.x) and internet access to download code and modules. I can provide assistance with setup on Linux/OSX but not on Windows machines. (If you would be able and willing to help others in the workshop using Windows then please let me know.)",SWIB
,2016,Implementing the IIIF Presentation 2.0 API as a Linked Open Data Model in the Fedora Repository,Christopher Hanna Johnson,,,SWIB/SWIB2016/Implementing the IIIF Presentation 2.0 API as a Linked Open Data Model in the Fedora Repository.md,"#swib/2016,#iiif,#iiif/api,#linke/open/data/model,#Fedora,#JSON-LD,#RDF/graph",""The IIIF Presentation API specifies a web service that returns JSON-LD structured documents that together describe the structure and layout of a digitized object or other collection of images and related content." IIIF website The dynamic serialization of IIIF JSON-LD structured manifests via SPARQL CONSTRUCT is an interesting possibility that has great potential for cross-domain discovery and rendering of digitized objects with variable criteria. I have explored this possibility by implementing a data model in the Fedora Commons Repository that matches the specifications of the IIIF Presentation API. Fedora has the facility to index objects via Apache Camel directly to a triplestore. With SPARQL CONSTRUCT, the triplestore can serialize normalized JSON-LD - JavaScript Object Notation Linked Data as a graph. The use of "ordered lists" (aka collections) is a fundamental component of JSON-LD and necessary feature of the IIIF manifest sequence which is represented in a canonical RDF graph as a cascade of blank nodes. In order to dynamically create the sequence with SPARQL requires that the data is modelled identically to the IIIF specification. This gist is a representation of a compacted and framed JSON-LD graph that was serialized from a SPARQL query of Fedora metadata. The ability to assemble parts of distinct, disparate and disassociated digital objects on demand in one cohesive presentation becomes a real possibility. For example, the "range" object is equivalent to a part of a sequence, like a chapter in a book. With SPARQL, it is possible to target ranges from different "editions" based on a metadata specification (i.e. a person, place, or date) and unify them in a manifest object which is then rendered by a client viewer like OpenSeadragon.",ISWC
,2016,Improving data quality at Europeana: New requirements and methods for better measuring metadata quality,"Péter Király,Hugo Manguinhas,Valentine Charles,Antoine Isaac,Timothy Hill",,,SWIB/SWIB2016/Improving data quality at Europeana New requirements and methods for better measuring metadata quality.md,"#swib/2016,#Europeana,#data/quality,#SHACL,#shortcomings","Europeana aggregates metadata from a wide variety of institutions, a significant proportion of which is of inconsistent or low quality. This low-quality metadata acts as a limiting factor for functionality, affecting e.g. information retrieval and usability. Europeana is accordingly implementing a user- and functionality-based framework for assessing and improving metadata quality. Currently, the metadata is being validated (against the EDM XML schema) prior to being loaded into the Europeana database. However, some technical choices with regard to the expressions of rules impose limitations on the constraints that can be checked. Furthermore, Europeana and its partners sense that more than simple validation is needed. Finer-grained indicators for the 'fitness for use' of metadata would be useful for Europeana and its data providers to detect and solve potential shortcomings in the data. Beginning 2016, Europeana created a Data Quality Committee to work on data quality issues and to propose recommendations for its data providers, seeking to employ new technology and innovate metadata-related processes. This presentation will describe more specifically the activities of the Committee with respect to data quality checks: - Definition of new data quality requirements and measurements, such as metadata completeness measures; - Assessment of (new) technologies for data validation and quantification, such as SHACL for defining data patterns; - Recommendations to data providers, and integration of the results into the Europeana data aggregation workflow.",SWIB

LD4P is a collaboration between six institutions (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Library of Congress, Princeton, and Stanford University) to begin the transition of technical services production workflows to ones based in Linked Open Data (LOD). This first phase of the transition focuses on the development of the ability to produce metadata as LOD communally, the enhancement of the BIBFRAME ontology to encompass multiple resource formats, and the engagement of the broader academic library community to ensure a sustainable and extensible environment. As its name implies, LD4P is focused on the immediate needs of metadata production such as ontology coverage and workflow transition. In parallel, Cornell also has been awarded a grant from the Mellon Foundation for Linked Data for Libraries-Labs (LD4L-Labs). LD4L-Labs will in turn focus on solutions that can be implemented in production at research libraries within the next three to five years. Their efforts will focus on the enhancement of linked data creation and editing tools, exploration of linked data relationships and analysis of the graph to directly improve discovery, BIBFRAME ontology development and piloting efforts in URI persistence, and metadata conversion tool development needed by LD4P and the broader library community.

The site supports multi-granular discovery of 1,400+ digitized emblem books and 25,000+ individual emblems from selective emblem books. To better integrate with related digital images and textual resources elsewhere, and to provide additional context for users, the site exploits linked open data (LOD) in two ways. First, as a producer of LOD, it publishes emblem and emblem book metadata as HTML+RDFa with schema.org semantics, making emblem resources more visible and useful in a linked open data context. Second, as a consumer of LOD, it enhances user experiences by utilizing LOD services and resources. For example, using the Iconclass LOD service, Emblematica Online supports multi-lingual browsing of the Iconclass vocabulary and connects users to digital sources elsewhere that share Iconclass descriptors. Also, it provides additional context about authors and contributors, including gender, nationality, and occupation, by reconciling names appearing in emblem metadata with LOD sources, such as the VIAF, DNB, and Wikipedia.

The more relations you find among these performance-related objects, the more it emerges as a perfect use case for linked data. At the University Library Frankfurt am Main, the Specialised Information Service Performing Arts aggregates performing arts-related metadata of artefacts gathered by German-speaking cultural heritage institutions. It is funded by the German Research Foundation and aims to give researchers access to specialized information by providing a VuFind-based search portal that presents the metadata modeled as linked and open data. The Europeana Data Model (EDM) offers a universal and flexible metadata standard that is able to model the heterogeneous data about cultural heritage objects resulting from the data providers’ variety of data acquisition workflows.

Based on text-, speech- and image recognition text-based metadata are automatically extracted from the videos and mapped to subject specific GND subject headings via named entity linking. This results in an enrichment of the reliable authoritative metadata by time-based metadata from video analysis.

Right after the war as many of these newspapers as possible were physically preserved by Dutch memory institutions. They were described in formal library catalogues that were digitized and brought online in the ‘90s. In 2010 the national collection of underground newspapers – some 200.000 pages – was full-text digitized in Delpher, the national aggregator for historical full-texts. Having created online metadata and full-texts for these publications, the third pillar 'context' was still missing, making it hard for people to understand the historic background of the newspapers. We are currently running a project to tackle this contextual problem. We started by extracting contextual entries from a hard-copy standard work on Dutch illegal press and combined these with data from the library catalogue and Delpher into a central LOD triple store. We then created links between historically related newspapers and used Named Entity Recognition to find persons, organisations and places related to the newspapers. We further semantically enriched the data using DBPedia. Next, using an article template to ensure uniformity and consistency, we generated 1.300 Wikipedia article stubs from the database. Finally, we sought collaboration with the Dutch Wikipedia volunteer community to extend these stubs into full encyclopedic articles. In this way we can give every newspaper its own Wikipedia article, making these WW2 materials much more visible to the Dutch public, over 80% of whom uses Wikipedia. At the same time the triple store can serve as a source for alternative applications, like data visualizations. This will enable us to visualize connections and networks between underground newspapers, as they developed over time between 1940 and 1945.",SWIB

The aim of the project was twofold: to examine Linked Open BNB usage and to potentially develop a tool of interest to the wider Linked Open Data community. We will describe the analytics platform and the functionality it provides as well as demonstrate what we found out about the usage of our data. Over the period under consideration (April 2014-April 2015) usage of the Linked Open BNB increased, and there was a discernible growth in the number of SPARQL queries relative to HTTP queries. Usage patterns were traced to the addition of new metadata elements or to linked data tuition sites or events.",SWIB
,2016,d:swarm - A Data Management Platform for Knowledge Workers,"Thomas Gängler,Thomas Gersch,Christof Rodejohann",,,SWIB/SWIB2016/dswarm - A Data Management Platform for Knowledge Workers.md,"#data/management,#etl,#swib/2016,#d-swarm,#etl","d:swarm is a data management platform intended for knowledge workers, e.g., system librarians or metadata librarians. Right now, the focus of this application is on realizing one of the most import steps of an ETL task - the transformation part. Our handy d:swarm Back Office UI can be utilized to create and verify mappings of a certain data source (with help of a sample dataset) to a certain target schema (e.g. schema.org bib extension). This GUI simply runs as a web application in your browser. Besides, one can apply the created and verified mappings with help of the d:swarm Task Processing Unit to process larger amounts of data (i.e. the real datasets). Afterwards, the mapped/resulted data can be imported into various data stores and exported to different formats, like search engine indices (e.g. Solr) or Linked Data. Workshop participants will learn how to use and interact with the d:swarm Back Office UI and d:swarm Task Processing Unit. Furthermore, some background about the design and architecture of the whole d:swarm application will be imparted. Finally, we will show how one can share (self-made) mappings rather easily with the rest of the (library) world. This workshop should treat a common, full ETL workflow of library data processing, i.e. preprocessing and/or harvesting of source data (optional), data mapping with help of d:swarm Back Office UI + applying the mappings to larger amounts of data with help of the d:swarm Task Processing Unit, loading the resulting data into a data store (to be concrete search engine index) + exporting as Linked Data, showing an application (catalogue frontend) that retrieves data from that datastore and uses Linked Data. Audience: systems librarians, metadata librarians, knowledge workers, data mungers. Expertise: Participants could be familiar with ETL Tools (GUI), e.g., OpenRefine or Talend. Required: Laptop with VirtualBox installed. Organizers will provide a VirtualBox image (Linux guest system) beforehand. Participants can also install their own environment. Programming experience: Not required. (However, domain knowledge and/or knowledge about the data formats themselves can and should be an advantage).",SWIB
