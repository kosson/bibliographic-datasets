,2019,20 million URIs and the overhaul of the Finnish library sector subject indexing,"Matias Frosterus,Jarmo Saarikko,Okko Vainonen",,,SWIB/SWIB2019/20 million URIs and the overhaul of the Finnish library sector subject indexing.md,"#swib/2019,#finland,#YSA,#LCSH,#SKOS,#Melinda","The library sector of Finland has been using the General Finnish Thesaurus YSA and its Swedish language counterpart Allärs for over thirty years. YSA is the most widely used thesaurus in Finland and comprises of some 36,000 concepts. Lately, the National Library of Finland has been developing the General Finnish Ontology YSO, a multilingual successor of YSA and Allärs built according to linked data principles. YSO has been linked to the Library of Congress Subject Headings, over a dozen Finnish vocabularies, and Wikidata. This year, the development of YSA and Allärs was frozen and the Finnish libraries are switching to using YSO and linked data en masse. This presentation describes the process of the switch and the lessons learned. First, we needed two sets of conversion rules: one for converting the SKOS YSO into MARC authority records to support the subject indexing processes and another one to convert the millions of bibliographic records from YSA and Allärs annotations to YSO. Devising the rules turned out to be a very complex task and we formed an expert group with representation from various types of libraries. The conversion extends from the national union catalog Melinda to the local library databases employing various library systems. To this end we developed open source conversion programs and made them available to libraries and library system providers. Aside from the conversion, we also added YSO URIs to the MARC records making linking and updates simpler in the future.",SWIB

For the task of providing subject-based access to information resources of different kinds and with varying amounts of available metadata, it has become necessary to explore possibilities of automation. In this hands-on tutorial, participants will be introduced to the multilingual automated subject indexing tool Annif as a potential component in a library’s metadata generation system. By completing exercises, participants will get practical experience on setting up Annif, training algorithms using example data from the organizing institutions NLF and ZBW, and using Annif to produce subject suggestions for new documents using both the command line interface and the web user interface and REST API provided by the tool. The tutorial will also introduce the corpus formats supported by Annif so that participants will be able to apply the tool to their own vocabularies and documents. Participants are requested to bring a laptop with at least 8GB of RAM and at least 20 GB free disk space. The organizers will provide the software as a preconfigured virtual machine. No prior experience with the Annif tool is required, but participants are expected to be familiar with subject vocabularies (e.g. thesauri, subject headings or classifications) and subject metadata that reference those vocabularies.",SWIB

,2019,Cool and the BnF gang: some thoughts at the Bibliothèque nationale de France about handling persistent identifiers,Raphaëlle Lapôtre,,,SWIB/SWIB2019/Cool and the BnF gang some thoughts at the Bibliothèque nationale de France about handling persistent identifiers..md,"#swib/2019,#BnF,#PID,#RAMEAU,#indexing,#SPAR,#digital/preservation","“Cool URI’s don’t change,” as Tim Berners Lee wrote in 1998, implying that URIs should remain the same as long as possible. Still, cool URIs are also supposed to use web protocols to communicate information about the object they identify. This second requirement somehow contradicts the first, as web protocols are also mutable. Indeed, the recent transition of a lot of web resources towards the secure version of HTTP for indexing purposes brought change in URIs. At the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), this recent evolution of web technologies, combined with a revision of our indexing language RAMEAU, prompted us to start a thinking process about what in URIs should constitute durability - other than the immutability of the URI design. For now, the BnF’s answer is twofold: a URI should be considered completely stable only if the identified resource is somehow digitally preserved. As the BnF has a tool for digital preservation at its disposal (SPAR), it should also have a tool that keeps track of changes in URIs. Furthermore, the institution should communicate about its policy regarding the future of the URIs it is handling, even if this policy implies possible mutation or disappearing of the identifier: thus, reliability of the identifier wouldn’t solely depend on the permanence of its design, but also on the trustable transparency of the institution with regards to its commitment in maintaining identifiers.",SWIB
,2019,Data modeling in and beyond BIBFRAME,Tiziana Possemato,,,SWIB/SWIB2019/Data modeling in and beyond BIBFRAME.md,"#swib/2019,#Share-VDE,#BIBFRAME,#bibliographic/data","Share-VDE has reached its production phase, with over 20 libraries involved in the analysis, conversion, enrichment and publication of their data (originally in MARC21) according to BIBFRAME. Unlike some software components, the deliverables (library datasets and the Cluster Knowledge Base) are open source and accessible as dump and/or as SPARQL end-point, available to enhance other databases. Share-VDE uses external sources in various formats (VIAF, ISNI, Wikidata, LC data etc.) in the enrichment process. Share-VDE tools are evolving and aim to allow librarians wider and more direct interaction with bibliographic data expressed in Linked Data. The CKB editor and the URI Registry, two of the main tools for this direct interaction with data in LD, permit data to be validated, updated, controlled and maintained, ensuring a quality that massive and automated procedures cannot fully guarantee. The CKB Editor will be released in open source as an RDF/BIBFRAME Editor. Since the CKB is released in two versions (Postgres database, for internal use, and RDF, for external use), the update procedures will connect with both versions, using APIs to align them through automatic and manual procedures. Further analysis is also being carried out to verify how the BIBFRAME ontology complies to the requirements of a collective catalogue, intended as a catalogue produced by the integration of independent library catalogues. In this context, the SuperWork and Master Instance concepts implemented in Share-VDE are considered necessary extensions of the BIBFRAME ontology to better identify and qualify more specific entities. The presentation will touch upon these complex issues, typical of the current technological environment, but still conditioned by the dominant cataloguing tradition. Discussions and analysis of these topics, shared with the Library of Congress, will be presented.",SWIB

Our ambition is to close the digital research lifecycle: to make sure that digital research outputs can be discovered, accessed, and reused. We achieve this through the adoption of a common model to represent our digital knowledge, and the implementation of linked open data technologies for data storage and exchange. At the centre of our infrastructure is a Knowledge Graph, which makes all our digital artefacts – be they sources, annotations or entire research databases – centrally accessible. Key challenges are to bring data from various sources together in ways that retain the original context and detail, and to provide users with an environment in which they are able to make sense of this vast information resource. We address these challenges by harmonising all input data to a common model (CIDOC-CRM) that does not compromise the data's original expressivity. The resulting graph becomes usable through ResearchSpace, a software system based on the semantic data platform Metaphactory. We have successfully implemented a pilot project to evaluate the feasibility of our approach and have implemented a production-ready first version of the entire system together with our partners.",SWIB
,2019,Empirical evaluation of library catalogues,Péter Király,,,SWIB/SWIB2019/Empirical evaluation of library catalogues.md,"#swib/2019,#MARC,#user-tasks,#metadata,#FRBR","The library community is in the transition period from Machine Readable Cataloguing (MARC) to some linked data based metadata schema. MARC is complex both as data structure and as semantic structure. This complexity leads to a wide range of errors. When we transform records from MARC to semantic schemas, we should not suppose that we have structurally and semantically perfect records. The aim of this presentation is to call attention to the typical issues revealed by an investigation of 16 library catalogues. The most frequent issue types are usage of undocumented schema elements, then improper values in places where a value should be taken from a dictionary, or should match to other strict requirements. MARC has a number of features which makes validation a challenge such as intensive use of information compressing and encoding techniques, versions without versioning, dependency on internal and external data dictionaries, it is huge (the “core” MARC21 has about 3000 semantic data elements, while other versions defined several hundreds more), and the standard itself is not a machine-readable rule set. Some of these errors might block the transformation of the records, some others might survive in the new structure as well if we do not fix them. The research aims to detect different issues of the metadata records. The foremost of them are those which do not fit the rules defined by the standard. Organized by structure the tool detects issues on record level, in control fields, in data fields, in indicators and in subfields. It also calculates completeness, Thompson-Traill completeness, runs a functional analysis based on the FRBR defined “user tasks” and provides a web based user interface. In the research process a tool has been built which contains an (exportable) object model of the standard.",SWIB

As the gathered metadata tends to be very heterogeneous due to various software solutions, workflows and material types in the participating GLAM institutions, not only the differences in data format and standardization are a challenge for modeling data as LOD. This talk also highlights how the differences in scope and detail of description, the lack of a common vocabulary and the handling of entities are tackled in order to make the collections linked and searchable. Over the years, we learned that thorough analysis of the delivered metadata in cooperation with the data providers is key in improving the search experience for users. The current workflow from raw to linked data basically involves four steps: (1) thorough analysis and documentation of the delivered data, (2) preprocessing of the raw data for more interoperability, (3) modeling and transforming the preprocessed title and authority data in EDM, (4) interlinking and enrichment of the entities. Though the resulting enriched metadata can not always be given back to the data provider's in-house database, this workflow includes the creation of best practice documents for the performing arts GLAM community based on the results of the analysis. We will focus on the impact of the data's heterogeneity on the workflow by describing the different, possibly data provider-specific, stages of the process and their limitations.'",SWIB

It is built upon the MARC21 library records as the main source of data, and transformed into RDF through a pipeline of analysis, defragmentation, and data re-clustering into the FRBR-based data model. On top of this, a new entity-driven “catalogue” is built for the use of general public and for enhanced discovery from search engines. Datos.bne is an experimental development, making room for testing unconventional workflows for metadata production and creation, breaking up the sometimes rigid conventions taking place in national libraries. This presentation will explore some of the most prominent features in this workflows, and discuss pros and cons found along the way, or how this may influence library metadata production in the near future. One of the most recent features has been the massive data ingestion from Wikidata into 80.000-odd person library records, including properties as gender, birth place, occupation, language, field of work or membership. The matching between library records and Wikidata records was made based on Wikidata identifiers present on authority records. These identifiers were initially extracted from VIAF identifiers datadump file and loaded into the library authority records. After that initial massive load, catalogers have been routinely adding more wikidata URIs when available. After a file was extracted from the library authority file, containing BNE Ids and Wikidata IDs, the library technological partner for this venture got the data through the Wikidata API. After extensive quality check-up, massive modifications, and alignment with the library subject terms, the data were succesfully loaded into the library records, and will be processed for its use in the datos platform, closing the feedback circle.",SWIB
,2019,Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks,"Magnus Pfeffer,Kai Eckert",,,SWIB/SWIB2019/Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks.md,"#swib/2019,#Jupyter-Notebook,#workshop,#IPython","Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application for creating and sharing “live documents” that can contain code and the results from its execution besides traditional document elements like text or images. Originally being developed as part of the IPython project, it is now independent of Python and supports a long list of different programming languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, R and Perl. These live documents are uniquely suited to create teaching materials and interactive manuals that allow the reader to make changes to program code and see the results within the same environment: program outputs can be displayed, visualisation graphics or data tables can be updated on-the-fly. To support traditional use cases, static non-interactive versions can be exported in PDF, HTML or LaTeX format. For data practitioners, Jupyter Notebooks are ideal to perform data analyses or transformations, e.g., to generate Linked Open Data, where the workflow documentation is part of the implementation. Single lines of code can be added or changed and then executed without losing the results of prior parts of the code. Visualizations can be generated in code and are directly embedded in the document. This makes prototyping and experimenting highly efficient and actually a lot of fun. Finally, Jupyter Notebooks are an ideal platform for beginners, as they can execute code line by line and immediately see how changes affect the result. This workshop requires no prior knowledge of Jupyter Notebooks or the Python programming language; only basic programming and HTML/Markdown knowledge is required. Please bring your own laptop.

The aim of NAISC is to meet the unique interlinking requirements of the library domain and to improve LD accessibility for domain expert users. At SWIB 2019 we will present our progress in the development of NAISC including an improved graphical user-interface (GUI), user testing results, and a demonstration of NAISC’s interlink provenance components. NAISC consists of an Interlinking Framework, a Provenance Model and a GUI. The Framework describes the steps of entity selection, link-type selection, and RDF generation for the creation of interlinks between entities, such as people, places, or works, stored in a library dataset to related entities held in another institution. NAISC specifically targets librarians by providing access to commonly used datasets and ontologies. NAISC incudes interlink provenance to allow data users to assess the authoritativeness of each link generated. Our provenance model adopts PROV-O as the underlying ontology which we extended to provide interlink specific data. An instantiation of NAISC is provided through a GUI which reduces the need for expert LD knowledge by guiding users in choosing suitable link-types. We will present NAISC and demonstrate the use of our GUI as a means of interlinking LD entities across libraries and other authoritative datasets. We will also discuss our user-evaluation processes and results, including a NAISC usability test, a field test/real-word application of NAISC, and a review of the interlink quality.

Alongside a SPARQL endpoint providing a dynamic query service, an interface also aims at directing users among the BnF collections thanks to FRBRized metadata. In 2017, the idea of proposing a visual recommendation system based on Linked Open Data technologies emerged from discussions with data.bnf.fr users. As this idea implied visualizing large and complex datasets, the data.bnf.fr team decided to partner with the Human Computer Interaction research team ILDA (Interacting with Large Data). This collaboration contributed to the design of S-paths, an interactive data visualization interface that aims at providing meaningful insights about Linked Datasets. S-Paths allows users to navigate linked open data more intuitively by systematically presenting the most readable view for a given set or subset of similar entities. The main obstacles encountered during this experiment include the heterogeneity of the data, which challenged the system’s selection algorithm, as well as performance issues when querying SPARQL endpoints, partly related to the complexity of the FRBR model. Despite those difficulties, S-paths proved very useful to reveal defects in data sources, visualize modeling specificities, and show trends in the data that can be used for communication towards end users.",SWIB

It was argued that linked data would help the KB to publish not just 'on the web' but also 'in the web', allowing others to reuse and link to KB data. Although a growing interest exists in extending linked data principles to core library registries, for example the catalogue, the practice of publishing linked data at the KB involved following a cascade of export, modelling or remodelling, conversion, selection and transformation steps. Various conversion routes were followed, depending on the data, systems and tools at hand. Presented will be the steps that were applied, leading to the RDF published at DBN. Besides these technical steps, perhaps most crucial in creating linked data is the semantic modelling or the design principles to be adhered to. It is crucial since the model applied may greatly impact the usability of the output. Moreover, it complex since it requires people with differing backgrounds to collaborate, to understand and acknowledge each others expertise and perspectives and to arrive at a common language and model. This complex step hasn't reached it conclusion yet. The design principles behind the data now at DBN may be summarized as generally established best practices plus a schema.org serialization. To further enhance and extend the published data, a more elaborate set of principles is required. Those principles will not to be applied to data at DBN only. As a 'generic KB entity model for content' it is thought of as the unifying metadata model for KB content related metadata. This work-in-progress model, based on IFLA-LRM and PREMIS, will be presented.

With a growing supply of resources on the web, the challenge grows to learn about or find resources relevant for teaching, studies, or research. Current approaches provided by libraries for publishing and finding open content on the web are often focused on repositories as the place to publish content. Those repositories provide (ideally standardized) interfaces for crawlers to collect and index the metadata in order to offer search solutions on top. Besides being error-prone and requiring resources for keeping up with changes in the repositories, this approach also does not take into account how web standards work. In short, the repository metaphor guiding this practice obscures what constitutes the web: resources that are identified by HTTP URIs. In this presentation, we describe the SkoHub project being carried out in 2019 by the hbz in cooperation with graphthinking GmbH. The project seeks to implement a prototype for a novel approach in syndicating content on the web. In order to do so, we make use of the decentralized social web protocol ActivityPub to build an infrastructure where services can send and subscribe to notifications for subjects defined in knowledge organization systems (KOS, sometimes also called “controlled vocabularies”).

While the many “V”s of big data (volume, velocity, variety, variability, veracity) are crucial, the “V”alue of such data relies on the ability to achieve big insights from smart data—the trusted, contextualized, relevant, cognitive, predictive, and consumable data at any scale. The smart data concept is essential in relation to the role of libraries, archives, and museums (LAMS) in supporting Digital Humanities (DH) research. Rapid development of the digital humanities field creates a demand for bigger and smarter historical and cultural heritage data carried by information-bearing objects (textual or non-textual, digitized or non-digitized), which would typically not be obtainable through web crawling, scraping, real-time streams, mobile-analytics, or agile development methods. Increased funding for research in DH and innovative semantic technologies have enabled LAMs to advance their data into smart data, thus supporting deeper and wider exploration and use of data in DH research. In this talk, the speaker shares an understanding of the what, why, how, who, where, and which data, in relation to smart data and digital humanities. Particular attention is given to the distinctive roles big data and smart data play in the humanities, which is seemingly marked by a methodological shift rather than a primarily technological one.

In the course of our continued development we have begun exploring the feasibility of semantic technologies (RDFS and OWL) for more wide and open-ended data integration. OWL inferencing is sometimes considered a foundational mechanism for automatic semantic interoperability. But we need to go about it differently in order for semantic mappings to become a practical tool for effective data integration. OWL reasoners are rarely used when automating ingestion or publication of linked data. Reasoners aren't readily targeted at specific applications, but expand all possible implications of a set of statements, yielding rather unwieldy data. Meanwhile the web of data at large continues to grow, and between organizations more and more integration needs crop up. These needs commonly have to be solved right now, thus requiring us to write up more custom integration code, with little reuse even within one organization. It is not uncommon to device custom mappings between RDF vocabularies as a part of these often complex ETL pipelines. Sometimes, these use SPARQL, sometimes XSLT, sometimes custom code with various non-portable dependencies. We're exploring an arguably simpler approach to address a given set of described use cases. It is based on preprocessing of vocabulary data, scanning their mappings and creating a target map from each known property and class to a predefined selection of desired target properties and classes. This computed "target vocabulary map" is then used when reading input data using the known terms, to produce the selected target description. This yields more predictive results tailored for conceived use cases. This presentation will elaborate on these considerations and explore the proposed solution, including limitations and possible shortcomings.'",SWIB
